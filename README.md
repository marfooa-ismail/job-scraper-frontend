## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Prompts**: No need to hardcode configurations! The scraper asks for your target position, a brief description, city, and work type at runtime.
- **Dynamic Keyword Engine**: Automatically expands your input into 15+ smart search queries. Also generates "must-have" and "negative" keywords tailored to the role.
- **Multi-Source Aggregation**: Extracts listings concurrently from 8 premium job boards and APIs:
  - **JobSpy**: Indeed, LinkedIn, Google Jobs, Glassdoor
  - **Free Remote APIs**: Himalayas, Remotive, Arbeitnow, RemoteOK
- **Intelligent Relevance Scoring**: Rejects unrelated jobs (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Senior roles when looking for Internships) and scores remaining jobs out of 100 based on title and description keyword density.
- **Freshness Filter**: Strictly pulls jobs posted in the **last 48 hours**.
- **Automated Deduplication**: Automatically handles duplicate URLs across multiple job boards.
- **Dynamic Export**: Outputs the highest-quality results to a dynamically named, quotation-safe CSV file (e.g., `backend_developer_internship_2026-05-31.csv`).
